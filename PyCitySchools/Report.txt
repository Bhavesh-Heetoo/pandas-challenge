To Summarize this analysis we had looked at school performance based on the average math and reading scores , Student budgets , passing percentages for Math and reading and total students. Data frames were also created 
to view results by school size , school type and passing percentages for diffrent grades.

One conclusion that can be drawn from this analysis is that the size(# of students) had an impact on students performance. I find that the small to medium size schools had better passing percentages then large schools as seen in the size summary section.

another conclusion can be drawn from our scores by school type. In this analysis we see Charter schools have high passing percentages when compared to District schools. For example , percentage passing in math for Charter schools is 93.6% whereas District is 66.54%. This is a clear indication that students are benefiting academically in math and reading when attending Charter schools.
